<h1>Game Devlog #1!</h1>

<p>
Hello again!<br/>
So this is the first devlog of the game, but I've been developing the game for something like a month now.
Because I'm working a full time job, the "month" I've been working on the game is not really a month, I manage to scrap a few hours here and there after work.
It all started when I was looking for a project to do and I decided to jump into threejs - which is amazing!
I decided to make a very small prototype for a game which turned out to be fun.
The Idea for the game was simple - cubes are spawning at a distance from you and slowly come towards you.
Each cube has a different color - Red Green or Blue and you need to shoot the right color at each cube.
<br/>
</p>

<p>
My friends played the prototype and they said it was fun! - and I felt happy that I made something that people really enjoy!
This feeling made me return to game development. Feeling that "this time it will be different" was not enough, I knew I need to change the way I've been developing my last games. One of the major decisions I took was to decide on the game scope now and make it small.
So the scope of the game is:
<br/>
<ol>
<li>Colorful cubes are coming at you - you need to shoot with the right color</li>
<li>As time passes the cubes become faster and faster, and their health is getting heigher</li>
<li>You can earn points and buy items which you don't know what they do like roguelike games</li>
</ol>
And that's it! Thinking that this small scope is nothing to make - I started working on it feeling like I'll finish in no time. 
<br/>
I WAS WRONG. 
<br/>
There is so much things to do, even with this small scope. And when you consider that I'm working a fulltime job alongside development - I got a real slap to the face.
<br/>

<p>
Yeaaahhhh, so in the near future I'm gonna put the game in my site and let people play it. I want to start iterating and improving the game depending on people feedback. I also built a custom enemy editor that I want to upload to the site - but I'm really not sure about it.
I'm currently working on the power curve of the enemies, and I a little lost on how to regulate the power curve with the enemies type that you can build in the enemy editor.
<br/>
</p>

<p>
Here is a picture of how the game look like right now:

I really want to start and play with some cool shaders and effects to make the game more appealing!
But I need a basic playable game first. And this is my main priority now, get a working game out there - ASAP.
</p>
<p>
See you next time,
<br/>
Roy (:
