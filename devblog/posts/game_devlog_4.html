Hi!<br/>
So a lot have happened this week, mostly in terms of mental change. Because I want to be a successful indie game developer (By successful I mean get enough money from my games to actually sustain myself and my indie dev career) I started to look more on how I'm making my game look more appealing to start gaining attraction and followers. I concluded that it's not a simple task, mostly because I'm doing a 3d game right now and it will be much more easier if I turned to doing a 2d game. So I decided that I'm dropping threejs and I'm going to use something which has more support and more community behind it. I started using Godot engine and I'm very surprised at how good Godot engine really is.
<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to make the smallest game possible and I'm gonna try and make it look so good that it gains attraction. I also concluded that if I'll make a story to the game, even the smallest one, the game will gain more visibility. If I'm making a game about avoiding objects that fly towards you, it will sound much more appealing if the objects flying to you has a story behind them. A good example is "Avoid the objects that your angry wife is throwing at you". If you add a little story to why your wife is throwing objects at you it sounds funnier already and I feel like a lot of people (and streamers / youtubers) would want to play this game.

Still I think it's a great challenge to make a game look good enough to make people actually take an interest in it. I really feel like this is my greatest challenge right now - How am I making my game visually appealing so I can gain attraction. One of my friends told me that I'm not thinking about the right thing, that the appearance of the game is not that important right now. But I see how games are getting attraction in all the social networks. If it's not catching the eye, if a gif of the game footage doesn't make you linger when you see it - it's just not good enough for people to want to buy.
<br/>
<br/>
Another thing is I'm not sure how to manage my time. My mind is always telling me that I'm not working enough on my game. It's something that I need to fix if I'm going to make this a full time career. It's just so hard to fix when you really feel that you are not getting anywhere. I guess this feeling will change when I'll start gaining support from people who like my game. But the motivation part is really annoying to handle with. A big part of the blame is that my full time job takes all my time and the intervals in which I'm making progress with my game are very slow.
<br/>
<br/>
I guess I'm learning and with time I'll get better at this (by this I mean all of the above). I need to relax and cut me some slack. Just take the time to learn how to deal with all of this.

See you next time,
<br/>
Roy (:
